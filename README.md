# My React Portfolio

## Description:
The main goal of this project is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on building an entire full stack application with user authentication and third-party npm packages do improve the functionality and user experience. I also learned how to use route handlers effectively to access, and modify a database through http requests. And lastly I learned some better ways to access data through the DOM by using event delegation with the event target.
